# Cybersecurity.

### 1. What is Information security?

**Information security**, also known as **cyber security,** is the practice of protecting sensitive information, *including hard data and digital data, from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.*

### 2. What is Cyber security?

**Cybersecurity** is a branch of **information security** that focuses on the protection of *electronic information and system that are stored, processed, or transmitted electronically.* This includes protecting computer systems, networks, and data.
	
### 3. What is Hacking?
**Hacking** refers to the unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of information or systems.

### 4. What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical hacking,** also known as **"white hat" hacking,** is the practice of legally and ethically accessing and testing computer systems and networks to identify vulnerabilities.

### 5. What are Vulnerabilities?

A **Vulnerability** is a *weakness* in a system or network that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.

### 6. What is Exploit?

An **Exploit** is a method or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability in a system or network. Once a vulnerability has been discovered, an attacker can develop an exploit to take advantage of it and gain unauthorized access to a system or perform other malicious actions. Exploits can take many forms such as software programs, scripts, or commands.

### 7. What is Payload?

A **payload** is the portion of malware or exploit that carries out the malicious action. It is typically a piece of code or data that is delivered through the exploit and executed on the target system. The payload can take many forms, such as a script, software program, or command, and it can be used to perform a variety of *malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, installing backdoors, or disrupting system operations.*

### 8. What is Vulnerability Research?

**Vulnerability research** is the process of *identifying and analyzing security weaknesses in software and systems* and taking steps to mitigate them. Techniques used in vulnerability research include code review, static and dynamic analysis, and penetration testing. The ultimate goal is to report vulnerabilities to the vendor or developer of the affected software or system so that they can be fixed.
	
### 9. What is a Vulnerability assessment?

The goal of **Vulnerability assessment** is to identify potential security weaknesses and provide a prioritized list of vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
		
### 10. What is Penetration testing?

**Penetration testing,** also known as **"pen testing"** or **"ethical hacking,"** is the process of legally and ethically simulating an attack on a computer system, network, or web application to *identify vulnerabilities and assess the security of the system.* The goal of penetration testing is to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker and to evaluate the effectiveness of the current security controls in place.
		
### 11. What are the different types of penetration testing?
	
*There are three types of penetration testing* **Black Box Testing, Gray Box Testing,** or **White Box Testing...**

**1. Black Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has no prior knowledge of the system and simulates an attack from the outside. This simulates a real-world scenario where an attacker does not have any knowledge about the system.

**2. Gray Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has some prior knowledge of the system, simulating an attack from an insider or someone who has already gained access to the system.

**3. White Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has complete knowledge of the system and simulates an attack from the inside. This type of testing is used to identify vulnerabilities that are not exposed to external attackers. 
		
### 12. Which of the approaches are used in penetration testing?

**1. Reconnaissance(Footprinting):-** Gather information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and software versions.

-	*There are two main types of reconnaissance:*

	-   **Passive:-** Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. This can be done through publicly available sources, such as websites and search engines.


	-   **Active:-** Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system. This can include techniques such as network scans and vulnerability scans and can raise the risk of detection.

**2. Scanning:-** Use tools to scan the target system for vulnerabilities and open ports and Banner Grabbing.
		
**3. Gaining Access:-** Attempt to gain access to the target system through various means such as network, OS, or application vulnerabilities. This may also include escalating privileges to gain higher access.
		
**4. Reporting:-** Document the findings and recommend remediation steps.

### 13. What are the different phases or steps involved in the hacking process?

**1. Reconnaissance:-** Gather information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and software versions. This can be done through passive or active means.

**2. Scanning:-** Use tools to scan the target system for vulnerabilities and open ports, and perform banner grabbing.

**3. Gaining Access:-** Attempt to gain access to the target system through various means such as network, OS, or application vulnerabilities. This may also include escalating privileges to gain higher access.

**4. Maintaining Access:-** Once access is gained, maintain access by injecting backdoors and trojans, using the system as a launchpad, sniffing/monitoring the network, and using resources.

**5. Clearing Tracks:-** Cover up any traces of the hacking activity by destroying proof and hiding any tools or files used during the hack.

**6. Reporting:-** Document the findings and recommend remediation steps to improve the security of the target system.

### 14. What are security threats and their types?
	
*Security threats refer to malicious activities or events that pose a risk to an organization's information systems and data. There are various types of security threats, including:*

	-	**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):-** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks involve intercepting and modifying communication between two parties without their knowledge.

	-	**Sniffing:-** Sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing network traffic for sensitive information.

	-	**Arp poisoning:-** ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning is a type of attack in which an attacker manipulates ARP cache entries on a network to redirect traffic to their device.

	-	**Phishing:-** Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that involves tricking the user into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, by posing as a trustworthy entity.
					
	-	**Dos/DDos:-** DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks involve overwhelming a server or network with excessive traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.

**2. Host/Node Attacks.**
			
-	*These attacks target a specific device or computer on a network, such as a server or desktop.*

	-	**OS Attack:-** An OS (Operating System) attack targets vulnerabilities in the software that runs a device or computer.

	-	**Insufficient training:-** Lack of proper training for employees on how to handle and protect server resources, which can lead to accidental damage or loss of data.

### 15. What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA triad is a model for information security that consists of three components: 
**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.**
		
-	**Confidentiality** means that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and is only available to authorized individuals.

-	**Integrity** ensures that the data remains unaltered and uncorrupted and that it is not subject to unauthorized modifications during transmission.

-	**Availability** refers to the ability of authorized users to access the information they need when they need it. This includes ensuring that systems, networks, and data are reliable, and that data can be recovered in the event of a disaster.
	
### 16. What is the Defense in Depth?

**Defense in depth** is a security strategy that involves implementing multiple layers of protection around a system or network to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats. The idea behind the defense in depth is that if one layer of security fails, there are multiple additional layers to prevent unauthorized access and minimize damage. This approach helps to create a strong, comprehensive security program that reduces the risk of security breaches and protects against a wide range of threats. Examples of different layers of defense in depth include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access control systems, and security monitoring tools.

### 17. What is Vulnerability management?

**Vulnerability management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems and data. The goal of vulnerability management is to reduce the risk of successful attacks by identifying and mitigating potential security weaknesses.
	
### 18. What is the difference between Red Team, Blue Team, and Purple Team?

**Red Team:-** A red team is a group of security experts who simulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of real-world attackers to test an organization's security defenses and identify weaknesses. The goal of a red team is to identify security gaps before attackers do and help organizations improve their overall security posture.

**Blue Team:-** A blue team is a group of security professionals who are responsible for defending an organization against cyber threats. The blue team is focused on detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents. They are the first line of defense in an organization's security strategy.

**Purple Team:-** A purple team is a combination of red and blue teams that work together to identify and mitigate security risks. The purple team is responsible for both simulating attacks and detecting and responding to security incidents. The goal of a purple team is to improve the overall security posture of an organization by combining the strengths of both red and blue teams.

### 19. What is CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)?

**CVE** is a *standardized identifier system for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities*. Each CVE entry includes a unique ID (format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN), brief description, and references. Maintained by MITRE Corporation, CVE provides a common language for discussing vulnerabilities across different security tools, databases, and organizations, enabling better coordination in addressing security issues.

### 20. What is CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)?

**CWE** is a *community-developed list of common software and hardware security weaknesses* that can lead to vulnerabilities. Unlike CVE which catalogs specific vulnerabilities, CWE categorizes types of flaws like "SQL Injection" (CWE-89) or "Buffer Overflow" (CWE-120). It serves as a common language for describing weakness types and helps developers understand and prevent security issues during development.

### 21. What is CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)?

**CVSS** is a *standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities* on a scale from 0.0 to 10.0. It evaluates vulnerabilities based on three metric groups: *Base* (intrinsic qualities), *Temporal* (time-dependent factors), and *Environmental* (user-specific impacts). CVSS scores help organizations prioritize remediation efforts by categorizing vulnerabilities as Low (0.1-3.9), Medium (4.0-6.9), High (7.0-8.9), or Critical (9.0-10.0).

### 22. What are Vulnerability Research Websites?

**Vulnerability Research Websites** are *online platforms providing information about security vulnerabilities, exploits, and threats*:

- **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)** - US government repository of vulnerability data
- **CVE Details** - User-friendly interface for CVE data
- **Exploit-DB** - Public exploit database by Offensive Security

- **Packet Storm** - Security tools and exploit archive
- **Zerodium** - Zero-day acquisition platform
- **MITRE ATT&CK** - Adversary tactics and techniques framework
- **Open Bug Bounty** - Responsible disclosure platform

### 23. What is Vulnerability Publication?

**Vulnerability Publication** is the *process of publicly disclosing security vulnerability details* after following responsible disclosure timelines. This includes publishing technical write-ups, proof-of-concept code, and remediation guidance through security advisories, CVE entries, conference presentations, or blog posts. Publications typically occur after vendors have patched the issue (usually 90-120 days) to balance transparency with user safety.

### 24. What is Vulnerability Selling?

**Vulnerability Selling** refers to the *commercial market for security vulnerabilities*, where researchers sell discovered flaws instead of reporting them freely. This includes legitimate channels like *bug bounty programs* and *vulnerability acquisition platforms* (Zerodium, Trend Micro's ZDI), as well as gray/black markets where vulnerabilities are sold to governments, brokers, or criminal groups. Prices vary from hundreds to millions of dollars based on the target software, exploit reliability, and exclusivity.

### 25. What is mean by Scope in Penetration Testing?

**Scope** defines the *boundaries, targets, limitations, and rules of engagement* for a penetration test. It clearly specifies what systems can be tested, testing methods allowed, time constraints, and any restrictions to prevent disruption. A well-defined scope protects both the tester and client by establishing legal boundaries and ensuring testing focuses on relevant assets.

**Example Scope:** *"This penetration test will focus on the external web application https://portal.clientsite.com, including associated APIs and authentication mechanisms. Testing will be gray-box in nature, using a test account with limited user permissions. Third-party services, internal systems, and production databases are out of scope. Testing will be performed during business hours, with daily activity reports sent to the IT security team."*

### 26. What is Bug Bounty?

A **Bug Bounty** is a *reward program offered by organizations to ethical hackers* who discover and responsibly report security vulnerabilities in their systems. Companies pay monetary rewards based on the severity and impact of discovered bugs, creating a win-win situation where organizations improve security while researchers earn money. Bug bounties can be *private* (invite-only) or *public* (open to all researchers).

### 27. What are Bug Bounty Platforms?

**Bug Bounty Platforms** are *intermediary services that connect organizations with security researchers*, managing the entire vulnerability disclosure process. Major platforms include:

- **HackerOne** - Largest platform with diverse programs

### 28. What is a Jump Box?

A **Jump Box** (also called **Jump Server** or **Bastion Host**) is a *secure, hardened computer that acts as a single entry point* to access devices in a separate security zone or network segment. It provides a controlled method for administrators and authorized users to connect to critical systems without exposing them directly to less secure networks. Jump boxes typically have enhanced logging, monitoring, and access controls to track all activities and prevent unauthorized access.

### 29. What is VPN (Virtual Private Network)?

A **VPN** is a *secure, encrypted tunnel between a user's device and a remote network*, allowing users to access resources as if they were directly connected to that network. VPNs protect data in transit from eavesdropping, enable remote workers to securely access corporate resources, and can mask a user's real IP address. Common types include *site-to-site VPNs* (connecting entire networks) and *remote access VPNs* (connecting individual users).

### 30. What is a Proxy Server?

A **Proxy Server** acts as an *intermediary between clients and destination servers*, forwarding requests and responses while potentially filtering, caching, or modifying traffic. Proxies can provide anonymity, content filtering, bandwidth savings through caching, and access control. Types include *forward proxies* (hiding client identity from servers), *reverse proxies* (hiding server details from clients), and *transparent proxies* (invisible to users).

### 31. What is CTF (Capture The Flag)?

**CTF (Capture The Flag)** is a *cybersecurity competition where participants solve security-related challenges* to find hidden "flags" (text strings) that prove they've successfully completed a task. These challenges cover various domains including web exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, and binary exploitation. CTFs help develop practical hacking skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork, making them popular learning tools at conferences and in cybersecurity education.

### 32. What are Cybersecurity Conferences?

**Cybersecurity conferences** are organized events where *security professionals, researchers, ethical hackers, and vendors gather to share knowledge* about the latest vulnerabilities, attack techniques, defensive strategies, and security tools. These conferences feature technical talks, hands-on workshops, tool demonstrations, and networking opportunities that help attendees stay current with rapidly evolving cyber threats and defense mechanisms.

- Students benefit from cybersecurity conferences by *gaining exposure to cutting-edge research, real-world attack scenarios, and industry best practices* not typically covered in academic curricula. These events provide opportunities to learn from experts, discover new tools, participate in capture-the-flag competitions, network with potential employers, and understand current industry trends. Many conferences offer student discounts or free community events, making them accessible learning platforms.

### 35. What are Major Cybersecurity Compliances?

**Major cybersecurity compliances** are *regulatory requirements and standards* that organizations must follow to protect data and maintain security. These include industry-specific regulations like GDPR for data privacy, PCI DSS for payment card security, HIPAA for healthcare data, and frameworks like ISO 27001 for information security management systems.

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
-  **GDPR** is a *comprehensive European Union data protection law* that came into effect in May 2018, fundamentally changing how organizations handle personal data of EU residents. It grants individuals rights including data access, correction, deletion ("right to be forgotten"), and data portability, while requiring organizations to implement privacy-by-design principles, obtain explicit consent for data processing, and maintain detailed records of data activities. Organizations must report data breaches within 72 hours to authorities and notify affected individuals without undue delay. Non-compliance can result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue, whichever is higher, making it one of the strictest privacy regulations worldwide.

**CERT-IN compliance**
-  **CERT-IN (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team)** issued *mandatory cybersecurity directives in 2022* requiring all organizations operating in India to report cyber incidents within 6 hours of detection. The regulations mandate maintaining logs of ICT systems for 180 days, conducting security audits, implementing time synchronization with NTP servers, and designating a Point of Contact for incident coordination. Covered entities include data centers, cloud providers, VPN services, and virtual asset service providers. Non-compliance can result in imprisonment up to one year or fines, making it crucial for businesses operating in India to establish robust incident response and logging mechanisms.

**PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**
-  **PCI DSS** is a *mandatory security standard for any organization that stores, processes, or transmits credit card data*, developed by major card brands (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB). The standard includes 12 requirements organized into 6 categories: building secure networks, protecting cardholder data, maintaining vulnerability management programs, implementing strong access controls, regular monitoring and testing, and maintaining security policies. Compliance levels (1-4) are determined by transaction volume, with requirements ranging from self-assessment questionnaires to annual on-site audits by qualified assessors. Non-compliance can result in fines from $5,000 to $100,000 per month, increased transaction fees, or losing the ability to process card payments.

**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**
-  **HIPAA** is a *US federal law protecting sensitive patient health information* from disclosure without consent or knowledge, applying to covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates. The Security Rule requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards including access controls, encryption, audit logs, and workforce training, while the Privacy Rule governs use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). Organizations must conduct risk assessments, implement security measures appropriate to their size and complexity, maintain business associate agreements, and report breaches affecting 500+ individuals within 60 days. Violations can result in civil penalties from $100 to $2 million per violation type per year, and criminal penalties including imprisonment for knowingly obtaining or disclosing PHI.

**ISO 27001**
-  **ISO 27001** is an *internationally recognized standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)*, providing a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information. It requires organizations to establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve their ISMS through risk assessment, treatment of identified risks, and implementation of comprehensive security controls from Annex A (114 controls across 14 categories). The standard follows a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle and requires regular management reviews, internal audits, and corrective actions. Certification involves a two-stage external audit by accredited bodies and annual surveillance audits, with full recertification every three years. While voluntary, ISO 27001 certification demonstrates security commitment to customers and partners, often becoming a contractual requirement in business relationships.
